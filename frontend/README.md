## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

This project implements a **Content-Based Recommendation System** using:

- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Cosine Similarity
- Feature Engineering (Artist + Genre)

### 🔄 How It Works:

1. User enters a song name.
2. The system processes song metadata.
3. Text data is converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
4. Cosine similarity calculates similarity scores.
5. Top similar songs are returned as recommendations.
